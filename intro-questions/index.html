        <h1>Christina's Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>1. Christina Oates, Communication Design, junior</p>

        <p>2. I am a ComDes major, and I am interested in learning how to make websites to see if it's something I want to do as my job.</p>

        <p>3. The only kind of experience I have with Computer Science and Code is CS 131</p>

        <p>4. I want to learn the basics of how to make a website myself.</p>

        <p>5. Changes in all sort of sizes because the paper only has one size and the screen has many.</p>

        <p>6. <a href="https://www.torebentsen.com/">Effective Design Website</a> </p>

        <p>I think this is an example of good web design because of the way that the aspects of the website move and transform as the user interacts with it.</p>

        <p>7. <a href="https://www.shademaster.com.au/">Effective Communication Website</a> </p>

        <p>I think this is an example of effective communicate in a website because it takes something boring like outdoor roofing, and shows and conveys that information in an interesting way that keeps users engaged and makes it easier to understand.</p>

        <p>8. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">Website That Works Well</a> </p>

        <p>I think this is an example of a generally good website because the chat GBT was easy to use as well as engaging and interesting for the user to engage with.</p>
