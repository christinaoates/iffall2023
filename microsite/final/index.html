        Diggs and Hutson met in grade school, and Hutson and Snipes were college roommates.[5] The group began in 2009 as a remix project, with Hutson and Snipes taking a cappellas of mainstream rap artists and making power electronics and noise remixes of them to amuse themselves. Diggs joined in 2010 and began to write his own raps over their compositions.[6] They self-released their debut mixtape, midcity, on their website on February 5, 2013.[7] Though their expectations were low, and despite minimal promotion, the album was well-received, and five months later, they signed to Sub Pop. Their first album, CLPPNG, was released on June 10, 2014.[6]
        <br>The group does not see their abrasive sound as a rejection of mainstream hip hop or reaction against it, but as part of a hip hop tradition, including the likes of Dr. Dre and Public Enemy producers The Bomb Squad, who experimented with production and also used harsh, musique concrète-esque techniques in their music. Similarly, they think of themselves as a rap group rather than industrial-rap, noise-rap, or other mash-up genres.[6]
        <br>On June 14, 2016, they released an EP, Wriggle.[8] They then released their second studio album, Splendor & Misery, later on September 9.[9] A science fiction concept album, Splendor & Misery was nominated for the 2017 Hugo Awards in the category of "Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)" on April 4, 2017.[10]
        <br>In 2017, the group released a single, "The Deep". The song was nominated for a Hugo Award in 2018, their second consecutive nomination in the "Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)" category.[11]
