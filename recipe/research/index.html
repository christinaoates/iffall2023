        <p>Caprese Chicken made over with juicy baked chicken thighs! Many Caprese Chicken recipes I have found over the last few months call for searing chicken with salt and pepper and adding vinegar right at the end. But, why? This recipe is different.

            Instructions
        </h3>

        <h4>
            Chicken
        </h4>

        <p>
            1. Preheat oven to 410 degrees F
            <br>2. Season each chicken thigh with oregano, basil, salt and pepper
            <br>3. Heat the oil in a large oven-proof pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes each side. Transfer chicken to a plate; drain most of the excess oil, leaving about a teaspoon worth.
            <br>4. Return the skillet back to the stove; fry garlic until fragrant (abt 1 minute). Add the vinegar and brown sugar; stirring to combine while heating through. Bring to a simmer, while stirring occasionally, until glaze has thickened (abt 5-6 minutes)
            <br>5. Return the chicken to the pan, turning in the glaze to evenly coat. Add 1 cup of the tomatoes, whole, around the chicken and place the chicken into the oven. Bake until the chicken is completely cooked through (about 30 minutes). Top each chicken with a slice of mozzarella cheese; return back into the oven for a further 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
            <br>6. Slice the remaining ½ cup tomatoes in half; place them on top of the cheese; pour over some of the balsamic sauce from the plan and garnish with basil. Serve immediately

        <p>7. Combine the vinegar and sugar in a small pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, allowing to simmer while stirring occasionally, until the glaze is thickened and reduced by half (abt 5-6 minutes). Drizzle over the chicken when ready to serve.

            This website had really interesting photography and visual hierarchy on the opening frame, which drew me in and 
            made me want to look futher into the website. the animations and choice of video is really 
            nicely done.

            I really liked this idea for a website as just being one guy who makes videos you can 
            just watch or follow along with. The format of the website is really easy to follow and is 
            nicely organized. the photography is consistent except for the change in food. Even the man's 
            shirt stays the same color, so the user understands this is one man making all these dishes.

            This website does a really good job of organizing the different recipies in a way that is 
            easy to find. Usually with recipe websites, they are very confusing just because there are so 
            many recipies to choose from and they haven't been organized in a way that is helpful. I think that
            here the organization and photography is really nice and effective.

            This website has a really good opening page I think. The typeface is really nice and the photography and the way the 
            photography frames the website title really drew me in. The way it animates inward was also effective, but is not something 
            I would be able to do.

            This website really asks the user what they are looking for from the website and directs them in that direction.
            It caters very nicely to the user experience through a series of choices the user has to make that are visually engaging 
            as well and kept me interested while I was using it.

            This website does not have as many animations as the other websites and is more of a scrolling down expereince with information, which I feel like
            is something I will be capable of doing. It does a good job of keeping the user interested with out having as many of those animations and just 
            as a one page scroll.
